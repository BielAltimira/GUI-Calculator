Hi!
In a few days I'm gonna be recieveing the Python Bible which is a long book that contains all the necesari to learn python and use it in diferent
scopes. While I wait for that I'm gonna be doing some easy and short projects to master the basics and be ready for the new concepts. This project
in particular is a GUI calculator made with the GUI module TkInter.
